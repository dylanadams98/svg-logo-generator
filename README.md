# svg-logo-generator

This task was to create a command-line executable application that generates a SVG logo image using input from questions asked to the user.

The application is easily deployable using simple commands, and is structured in a way that outputs all SVGs into one output folder.

This was a good project to build on command-line application skills and the inquirer package, but getting tests to work was a challenge.
